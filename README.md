Hey, guys. This is a simple game called "Flood It" written in SWIFT. You can try download this game and run it in your iPhone or iPad.  
Rules are really simple: You keep changing the colour of the top left grid until every grid has the same colour before running out of moves. When you change the colour, all the neighbours will with the same colour will be changed accordingly.  
I hope you enjoy the game!
